But insightful and informative as it is, Graeme Wood misses what should be his own primary take-home prescription.  Which puts me in mind of another excellent article, \"Early Warning: The Continuing Need for National Defense\", written by Claremont Institute President Brian Kennedy in March 2014.  At the time, Kennedy's article reminded me of an excellent March 2006 speech by scholar Bernard Lewis to AEI and then VP Cheney.  All three works are astonishing for pretty much the same reason.  March must be the month for avoiding the terror of the obvious, or the unwelcome truth.</p><p>All three see containment as essential, yet manage to ignore the most fundamental components of rational containment policy along with our most fundamental national defenses.</p><p>The most fundamental components of containment -- and our most fundamental, critical national defenses -- are, inescapably, our own borders and immigration controls - not those of Iraq or Syria.  The West's leaders have scuttled our most critical defenses in favor of culturally and nationally suicidal over-immigration policy, behind ostensible goals like \"cheap labor\" and \"multiculturalism\", and behind the covert goal of overwhelming the loyal native-born citizenry's voting control of the USA...</p><p>\"Cheap labor\" is in reality among the most expensive labor imaginable, costing society thousands of times more in pecuniary and non-pecuniary externalities than the paltry and transient wage savings pocketed by its proponents at the expense of their fellow citizens.  Indeed, to an increasing extent, imported \"laborers\" and their progeny are not labor at all, but clients of the \"government services\" state and the welfare state.  And excessive immigration, rather than yielding \"multicultural\" benefits, is trending towards cultural extermination and cultural terraforming in favor of harmful cultures and ideologies.  Most importantly, what over-immigration ensures, along the way to ensuring the destruction of the USA, is a few decades of Democratic Party hegemony, by permanently overwhelming the loyal and relatively-conservative native-born citizenry's voting control of the USA. Democrats and other advocates of open borders (RINO and neo-\"Libertarian\" collaborators) should enjoy their impending supermajority while it lasts - basically a coup d'etat without a shot fired - because it comes at a fatal cost to the USA even as they see it.</p><p>Bernard Lewis, a British Middle East expert, discussed the danger of Islam wrecking the West.  In effect he notes that if we lose, it will not be due to attack from outside, but because we accept the immigrant culture and fail to assimilate immigrants into our culture.  The glaring implication of his speech was how the west will be destroyed through immigration.  Yet Lewis never uses the word immigration.  He closes with:</p><p>\"But the idea of freedom in its Western interpretation is making headway.  It is becoming more and more understood, more and more appreciated and more and more desired.  It is perhaps in the long run our best hope, perhaps even our only hope, of surviving this developing struggle.\"</p><p>In 2015, it should be evident that this is wish-upon-a-star thinking, combined with the assumption, or hope, or conviction that we cannot or will not or should not even try to limit immigration.  Lewis makes not a single mention of our most fundamental national defenses (borders and immigration controls), and he ignores the logical conclusion that these are an indispensable core of rational containment strategy. What is the point of \"containment\" if we *import* fast-breeding Jihadis and natural Jihadi sympathizers by the millions, as if the ease or impossibility of assimilation has nothing to do with the absolute and percentage velocity and volume of immigration.</p><p>Presumably the mere mention of over-immigration as a ratcheting threat and immigration limits as a defense is declasse and verboten at the American Enterprise Institute, especially with Richard Cheney present.  Enterprise uber alles.  It appears Lewis either defers to or shares the neo-\"Libertarian\" belief that the citizenry has no moral right to limit immigration.  Open the borders to the world and hope that \"freedom\" will save us.  Just keep thinking positively and the universe will grant your wish.  Pretty grim when a policy leader as knowledgeable as Lewis can't or won't come to the logical policy indications of his own lifelong research.</p><p>Eight years later, Brian Kennedy continues the tradition:</p><p>\"We have today between five and ten million Muslims in the United States; and in surveys conducted by the Pew Research Center, 21 percent of these Muslims find suicide bombing acceptable and five percent have a favorable view of al Qaeda. That may be a low percentage, but five percent of five to ten million is a lot of people.\"</p><p>Like Lewis, not once does Kennedy ever use the word \"immigration\".  Nor does he use the words \"border\" or \"borders\".</p><p>A year later, Graeme Wood extends the tradition of ignoring the obvious prescription of returning to non-suicidal, sustainable, assimilable, beneficial immigration limits, controls, and criteria.</p><p>Are we supposed to be comforted that \"quietist Salafism offers an Islamic antidote to Baghdadi-style jihadism\"?  I don't think so.  Salafism is an extremist form of Islam that disdains cramming Islam down everyone else's throats \"for now\", but longs for the day when it's the right time to do so.  This \"antidote\" may not call for its adherents to engage in coercion, violence and intolerance, but the antidote itself is a natural breeding ground for the disease or venom itself, producing those who are not patient enough to wait for the \"true\" caliphate. This is evidenced by Mr. Baghdadi himself - the Islamic State Caliph himself - being a *non-quietist* Salafi. If Salafism is such a safe antidote, how did that happen?</p><p>And why do we need to inundate the West with this \"antidote\"?  We don't.  To the extent that it can even be argued that we do, it's due to the suicidal  over-immigration policy inflicted on the West by neo-\"Libertarians\", the Chamber of Commerce crowd, the Democratic Party and corrupt foolish collaborators in the Republican Party.</p><p>Suppose a group of businessmen imported an extremely obnoxious harmful species for some transient perceived self-serving benefit, at the fatal expense of the native species. Rather than admit the error or back off the betrayal when the damage becomes blatant - rather than inconvenience their personal interests by allowing more sensible loyal Americans to halt and reverse the importation - they want us to import even more of a somewhat less immediately and obviously harmful species, to eat or absorb the first harmful species faster than the second species itself outbreeds and destroys the native species.</p><p>We don't need to import more of the disease, or the venom, or the \"antidote\". To the extent that Salafism is an antidote, it's an antidote that is sorely needed in Islamic countries.  It would only be needed here if our leaders insist on continuing to subvert our society by importing the disease and its carriers and vectors by the millions. To the extent that we import either moderate or \"antidote\" Muslims, it facilitates the continued extremism to flourish abroad. The moderates and the \"antidotes\" need to stay and fix their own countries. To the extent we import \"moderate\" or \"antidote\" Muslims in large numbers, it reduces the pressure and power to moderate the Islamic world.</p><p>Fundamentalist Islam must be contained in Islamic countries before it gets here in the first place. Any \"containment\" strategy that doesn't recognize that fact is wishful and delusional, risking all for the sake of PC, self-serving, anti-national, anti-USA, open-immigration theories that anyone with a modicum of sense should be able to see as empirically discredited. The easy way to do that containment without getting into the distasteful, difficult and unnecessary job of limiting immigration by religion is to return *total* immigration flow to the kind of pleasant, beneficial, assimilable, non-suicidal overall percentage flows that prevailed in the four decades or so leading up to 1961. And prioritize the minimal remaining flow to countries that are not major breeding grounds of terrorism and intolerance (unfortunately, that may soon include Europe, due to the advanced suicidal stupidity of European immigration policy).  The overall flow would be far too high even it were all from non-Islamic regions anyway.</p><p>Intolerance of intolerance is no vice. Tolerance of intolerance is no virtue. Especially when it's culturally suicidal and delusional.</p><p>Fundamentally, the greatest enemy of the USA is not imported Islamofascism, but homegrown neo-\"Libertarianism\" (as opposed to true or paleo Libertarianism). Neo-\"Libertarians\" believe that any numerical limit on legal or illegal immigration is immoral, which means they are subversive to the meaning and value of citizenship and morally opposed to the existence of sovereign countries, which means they are morally opposed to the continued existence of the USA as an independent constitutional Republic controlled by its citizens. Without numerical limits on immigration, the USA would quickly become owned and controlled by the world. Everyone in the world would effectively be an \"undocumented citizen\". Imagine that, in a world of 7.5 billion growing rapidly to twice that number, any of whom could decide to make it official at any time in the neo-\"Libertarian\" paradise of unlimited immigration. Imagine a USA sardine-canning and rat-racing from 300 million to a Darwinian 3 billion. Even if none of the 3 billion were Islamists... For those promoting this, from whatever motive - whether it's gaining political control without the bother of having to convince your fellow citizens, or the myopic greed of trying to hire imports for $1 an hour less than it would cost to hire 100 million unemployed and underemployed Americans - is it really worth it? Are you sure? Because once it's done you can never take it back.</p>", "size": 16}, {"author": "disqus_e8WE4XS05J", "children": [], "name": "<p>good standard of journalism</p>", "size": 7}, {"author": "West_Coast_Polack", "children": [], "name": "<p>I couldn't agree more \u2014 thorough, well thought-out, well-reasoned, well-sourced.
