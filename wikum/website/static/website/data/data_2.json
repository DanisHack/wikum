The experience I have had working in my field (I-banking) is that it is filled by armies of \"super-employees\". These individuals, usually men,\u00a0typically\u00a0have stay-at-home wives and thus are able to\u00a0out-compete\u00a0their colleagues with working spouses because they can work more hours, be available 24/7, and travel on short notice. \u00a0On top of that, it is a globalized profession that attracts talent from around the world; talent that are usually focused on getting to the top, not making the workplace more flexible. \u00a0Changing a few policies is not going to alter the fact that these \"top jobs\" still require an intense degree of competition and those who \"give it their all\" are going to continue to prevail. \u00a0</p><p>Dr. Slaughter acknowledged that she was writing for a highly-educated, career-focused audience. The majority of people in this country require two incomes to survive and what they need is legislation mandating a longer, paid paternity leave (for both men and women) and subsidized childcare. \u00a0The audience that Dr. Slaughter is writing for are not chasing 9-5 jobs. Instead, they are aiming for the pinnacle of their field, which means being \"always on\". \u00a0Within a relationship, that is very hard to do if both spouses are aiming for the \"top\". \u00a0How would the author have managed her job if her husband's career was as (or more) time intensive and challenging as her State Department position?</p><p>The reality is that if you are going to get to the top, you most likely need a spouse who is willing to downshift their career, be willing to move for work, etc.\u00a0I have worked with very successful women at the highest levels of the corporate ladder and what they had in common with the guys is that they had made the same sacrifices when it comes to family involvement.  It's simple math. If you work 60+ hours a week as most executives and professionals do, you will not have time to be an uber-parent.  You can have one person stay home, call on help from relatives and friends, hire nannies, or use childcare, but because of the nature of the job, your primary existence is your place of work. You visit home.</p><p>That is why I recently decided to quit I-banking. \u00a0I do not have children yet, but I do have a wife who has a demanding career, and it became\u00a0abundantly\u00a0clear to me that she would not be able to aim high in her career aspirations if I was still working the 80-100 hour weeks with extensive travel necessary to be successful. \u00a0The solution for me was to become self-employed. It was the only way I could maintain my lofty ambitions, while at the same time achieving the\u00a0flexibility to be an involved parent and supportive (and present) spouse.</p><p>To Ms. Sandberg, who says you shouldn't \"leave before you leave\", I think that your advice is wrong.  Planning my family is just important as planning my career and I certainly take kids into account when I make my long-range career plan.  Both men and women should be encouraged to do so....a message that was sadly lacking all through college and early adulthood.</p><p>Listen, if you want the top job, there are sacrifices one has to make. \u00a0It is just not going to change. There are always going to be a sub-set of people who, faced with a major opportunity, will be willing to seek that goal to the detriment of their marriage and kids.  For example, there are many people who would jump at the chance to run policy for the State Department and would conclude that their actions will affect billions, so their child or spouse will just have to suck it up and hopefully someday appreciate the global impact of what they were accomplishing.</p><p>These articles put forward by the Atlantic are conversation inducing, but they focus on such a narrow slice of the population. I am looking forward to the next iteration of this topic in this\u00a0magazine, but hope that the focus is on the hundreds of millions of people who have working-class and middle-class jobs (rather than the hundreds of thousands of people who face the dilemmas outlined in the article). Those couples require two incomes to survive and have meager benefits and hopefully some sort of healthcare. God forbid they lose their job and someone gets sick. Nor can these jobs that done remotely.  They encounter work/life/parenting dilemmas that the \"privileged\" class of workers just do not face.</p><p>To Dr. Slaughter, I sincerely thank you for starting this conversation.  Our public sphere suffers from a paucity of public intellectuals and I am very grateful that someone of your stature and standing speak would speak frankly so that people start talking about a subject that runs to the very core of who we are as human beings.  Thank you. Hopefully more people at the top will see this as a siren call of all employees, who want to do their jobs well, but are being pushed so hard that the fabric of their marital and familial life is being pulled apart.

We need to move to a system that recognizes 'universal caregiving' -- the fact that most families are dual-income families (or single-parent families), and that both partners (male, female, or same sex) have responsibilities to home as well as to their employers.

However, that success does not come without sacrifice, and in today's society most men don't have the choice to not strive for that.

The adage of \"working 9-5\" may even be entirely lost in the next generation.\u00a0</p><p>Our quest for infinite growth and our insatiable appetite for luxury goods, continuously placed just that small stretch out reach of the last prize is turning us into overworked, overstressed shells of our former selves.</p><p>I've been one of these shells, I still am one of these shells and roughly half-way through my life, give or take a glass of wine or two, I'm wondering if it's all worth it. What moments do you cherish the most? The intimate moments with friends or family, relaxing, laughing, enjoying each others company, the weather, the scenery, the fruits of the earth or the ones in offices in suits and ties with colleagues high-fiving over some deal won or project completed or money made? Curled up by a fire reading a book, or merely having a good think - or hunched over the laptop \"revving the deck\"?</p><p>Personally, I applaud anyone who makes the former choices in favour of the latter. Man or woman. They are putting their hands up and saying something is not right and they are choosing time well spent over ego and materialism.\u00a0</p><p>I recently stayed at a B&amp;B in the south of France. The couple who run the place looked healthier, more relaxed and more in tune with each other than anyone I see on a daily basis here in London, hunched underneath someone's arm pit on the tube, bags under eyes, sweat forming on their brows. No, they don't have the latest MacBook with Retina display; no, they didn't bring democracy to Iraq; but boy did they look peaceful and happy. They might be accused of lacking ambition, of not contributing to the greater good (whatever that might be) but when they leave this world, unlike most others they won't have to say that they wished they spent more time with friends and family and less time at the office like most us will one day.\u00a0</p><p>So I'm thinking, maybe the woman who choose this life over the life of success that you've been struggling to balance are the smart ones. The problem is, we can't slow down. The picture of the world we've painted, the markets demanding infinite growth and infinite innovation doesn't let us slow down. Keeping up with the Jonses prevents us from taking time off. The media tells us what we should have and what we should achieve and we put our heads down and march on towards it, forgetting what's really important.</p><p>I'll leave you with this, Mrs. Slaughter, you got 12 days of vacation a year. There are roughly 260 working days in the US year, I'm guessing you probably spent half of your weekends working. You probably spent about 15% of your life with friends and family, and the rest trying to become a successful feminist professional.
