Performed disambiguation clean-up as per [[MOS:DAB]]

* Added Wiktionary link

* Removed links to 2 songs titled "Lemon Tree"; there are already links to them on the [[Lemon Tree]] dab page

* Also moved link for [[Lemon Myrtle]] to the [[Lemon Tree]] dab page since it seemed more logical

* Created [[Lemon (surname)]] page and moved people with the name "Lemon" to that page.

* Added links to [[Lemon (surname)]] and [[Lemon Tree]] to "See also" section.

* Removed "See also [[The Market for Lemons]]" from the entry for [[lemon (automobile)]].  The "Market" link is mentioned on [[lemon (automobile)]]

* Also removed the following for they do not belong on a "Lemon" disambiguation page. These are topics which include the word "lemon", but are not senses of of the word "lemon" that correspond to encyclopedic topics whose articles could logically be titled simply "Lemon":

** [[lemon battery]], is a battery made using a lemon.

** [[Lemon Demon]], Neil Cicierega's internet band.

** [[Salts of Lemon]], a bleaching agent made from [[Potassium oxalate]] (and the links were both red anyway...)

"In Swedish the citron is named Suckatcitron, - the citron of Succoth"

This is probably just a coincidence (or a folk etymology). According to the entry [http://g3.spraakdata.gu.se/saob/show.phtml?filenr=2/35/74439.html ''suckat''] ([[succade]]) in the etymological dictionary of the [[Swedish Academy]] ([[SAOB]]) the word is loanword from Italian where the word ''zuccata'' means candied pumpkin (''zucca''). The word ''zucca'', in its turn, is connected to an Indo-european root meaning "dry". /[[Special:Contributions/78.69.59.235|78.69.59.235]] ([[User talk:78.69.59.235|talk]]) 20:40, 7 December 2009 (UTC)

[2020-03-02 17:37:11,150: WARNING/ForkPoolWorker-1] == Contradiction in botanical description ==

There is the statement "The flowers are generally unisexual providing self-pollination..." under "Plant" in "Description and Variation".  This is contradictory.  Unisexual flowers have either male or female parts but not both, and self pollination of course requires both.  <small class="autosigned">&nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/108.56.145.198|108.56.145.198]] ([[User talk:108.56.145.198|talk]]) 02:34, 19 December 2015 (UTC)</small><!-- Template:Unsigned IP --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->
[2020-03-02 17:37:11,151: WARNING/ForkPoolWorker-1] == Citron != Yuzu/Yuja? ==

The reference to Koreans' culinary use of "citron" is a bit confusing. Koreans commonly drink a hot beverage made with honey and citrus fruit preserves called [[yujacha]]. In Korea, it's often labeled in English as "citron tea," but that may be a bad translation or maybe even just marketing (although U.S. ingredient labels for the stuff also call it citron). According to Wikipedia, the fruit in [[yujacha]] ([[yuzu]]) is suspected to be a hybrid of two other citrus fruits and neither of them are citron. The Korean and Japanese translations for [[citron]] do not point to [[yuzu|the fruit in yujacha either]]. I'm inclined to think the reference to Korean yujacha should be removed on this page because this article isn't about [[yuzu|yuja/yuzu]].  <small class="autosigned">&nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/76.111.5.136|76.111.5.136]] ([[User talk:76.111.5.136|talk]]) 23:46, 24 May 2016 (UTC)</small><!-- Template:Unsigned IP --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->
