## Participation guidelines

This project adheres to a [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code! Please report unacceptable behavior to [axz@mit.edu](mailto:axz@mit.edu).

## What we're working on
Our main goal right now is to improve Wikum. Take a look at the issues in our [current milestone](https://github.com/amyxzhang/wikum/milestone/1) or browse some [open issues](https://github.com/amyxzhang/wikum/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen%20is%3Aissue%20) to get started!


## How to contribute

1. **Comment on the issue and introduce yourself!** Let us know you're working on it, so we don't duplicate work. This will also be a good time for you to ask us any questions you may have about the issue and for us to provide additional context to you. 

2. **[Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) this repository**. This makes your own version of this project you can edit and keep in sync with the main one. 

3. **Check out a new branch** on your fork of the repository. Give it a descriptive name, like "readme-update" or "reply-bug". Make your changes on that branch. (If you're working on a coding issue, follow the [coding setup](/coding_setup.md) instructions to get all set up on your computer.

4. **Commit your changes**. Use a descriptive commit message!  

5. **Submit a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/proposing-changes-to-a-project-with-pull-requests/)** to merge your changes into the master branch. This opens a discussion around your changes and lets us know you are proposing them!
